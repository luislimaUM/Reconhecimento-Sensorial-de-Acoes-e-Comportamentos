  <p>The project described in this dissertation consists of the development of a decision support platform in the automotive industry. The main objective is the recognition of driver behavior as well as the tracking of its field of vision, in real time. The projection was made within the scope of the master's dissertation of the Integrated Master in Informatics Engineering of the University of Minho, in the specialty of Knowledge Engineering. </p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>

  <p>Just as organs play an important role in the human body, electronic sensors play a vital role in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Nowadays, it is increasingly difficult to find a technological sector that is not dominated by sensors, which has revolutionized various aspects of society.The sensors are increasingly evolved and aim to recreate the world's most intelligent sensory machine: "the human being."</p>
  <p>One of the areas in which AI technology most boosted was autonomous car systems, cars that integrate a set of control systems and actuator technologies to perceive the environment, determine the best options for action and execute them more safe. This project will be in the automotive industry, more properly in autonomous car systems, in order to increase the quality of life of users who enjoy this technology.</p>
  <p>In this context, the present dissertation presents a system that is capable of recognizing user behaviors, applying data science and machine learning algorithms to data, extracted mainly from video or image sensors, to identify patterns of to assist in decision-making. It consists of two case studies: detection and recognition of actions and emotions by the user and recognition and tracking of the driver's field of vision.</p>
